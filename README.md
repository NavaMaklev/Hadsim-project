# Hadsim-project
Part I Implementation of a system for managing a health fund, server side and database. Part II Product characterization and tests.
How to use:
This project was written in ASP .NET CORE WEB API Visual Studio.
To run it you need to create a database (I used SQLSERVER) and build the tables in formats
attached in the DataTabels.sql file.
During the run, Swagger will open and through it the system will be able to be operated: enter data, retrieve and watch
in the data summaries.
There is another detail about the system in the attached file Architectural specification.
